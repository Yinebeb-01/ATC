# ATC
Automatic temperature controller by using C- programming with PIC18F43K22
#embedded system
Steps to follow:
1. Copy all the header and source files into your project folder.
2. open the proteus file by using proteus software and test by loading the compiled project before doing on real devices.
3. Setup your circuits as depicted in the proteus simulation, load the compiled code onto your microcontroller, power it... you done!

#other features can be integrated with this project for future work, any one can try it.
