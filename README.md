# Automatic temperature controller(ATC) 

## Description
Source code of ATC written with C - programming language; targeted for **PIC18F43K22** microcontroller.

This project is a good starting point on embedded system programming.

## Usage
Follow below steps to configure and use:
1. Copy all the header and source files into your project folder.
2. open the proteus file(if you are testing on simulation) by using proteus software and test by loading the compiled project before doing it on real devices.
3. Setup your circuits as depicted in the proteus simulation, load the compiled code onto your microcontroller, power it... you done!

## Other resources, docs
I have wrote a blog for docs purpose including how to use, on medium, you can find [here](https://medium.com/@yintar5/automatic-temperature-controller-atc-for-various-purpose-by-using-c-programming-language-98950640355c)
